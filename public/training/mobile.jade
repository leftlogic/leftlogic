  # Mobile Web Apps

  Building rich interactive web sites... dare I say web apps - is a reality with the smart phone browsers shipping with all the latest JavaScript and CSS technologies.

  This day long workshop will be a mix of introducing the latest technology & tricks on the mobile device and hands on practical exercises where you'll get to play with what you're learning.

  Although this workshop will have an iOS focus, a lot of the technology we will look at applies to most new WebKit based devices (Android, Playbook, etc) and smartphones running Opera Mobile.
