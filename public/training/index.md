# Professional Training

#### At Left Logic, we know that many large organisations have in-house development teams. Sometimes it makes more sense to up-skill your own people rather than hiring agencies to develop for you.

Left Logic has packaged some of our expertise. We now offer specific training workshops to in-house teams wishing to brush up on their development skills, from latest HTML5 technology, mobile development & debugging to jQuery for Designers.

Left Logic also offers a tailored consultancy service. [Contact us for more information](http://google.co.uk).
