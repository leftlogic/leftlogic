# Left Logic v3

This is all the source code for https://leftlogic.com

The project is built React and Next.js for server side rendering, and for
production, the project is exported to an entirely static build.

The static build is deployed to Netlify with an additional custom
404 response pointing to
[/404](https://github.com/leftlogic/leftlogic/blob/73e1bd0b53781d8d12f4ffb18258ef104dc8d37f/pages/404.js).

Use `npm run dev` to develop and the React components will use
<abbr title="hot module reloading">HMR</abbr> to inject changes.

[Get in touch](mailto:info@leftlogic.com) if you'd like us to build something
like this for you, or using Node.js.

Otherwise, enjoy the source!
