      <blockquote>Remy worked with us (Milo Creative) towards the end of 2009 and completely got on board with the project we were working on. He gave a lot of thought and time to the work he did and carried it out expertly and on time. He was very flexible and worked as part of our team to achieve the project goals. He is very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend him.</blockquote>

      <p><strong>Top qualities: </strong>Great Results, Expert</p>
      <blockquote>Remy is a true expert when it comes to web devlopment. We hired him to work on a bespoke product display system involving complex filtering and sorting all achieved through javascript and ajax.<br /><br />

      Remy took time to fully understand what we wanted to achieve, taking into account wider commercial, design and usability aims before completing the work to a very high standard. His advice went beyond the scope of the project to advise us on performance and optimisation issues throughout our websites, and he has even helped us find new people to join our team. <br /><br />

      Remy is a personable, logical and industrious person and I look forward to working with him again.</blockquote>
