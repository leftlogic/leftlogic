    <h2>Working with JS Bin</h2>

    <p>JS Bin is a small to medium sized node project with a lot of features (many of which are unknown). It currently receives around 650,000 unique visitors each day which you'd be releasing bug fixes and new features to.</p>

    <p>During bug fix runs, JS Bin can have multiple releases per day - and there's room to streamline the release process.</p>

    <p>The code is not module (or make use of tools like require) and probably should do, and lots of magic happens with iframes and setTimeouts (48 setTimeout at the last count).</p>

    <p>The project is a passion side project turn primary focus, and the aim is to open the doors to pro users and team accounts as soon as possible so that JS Bin can continue to remain open source and address the concerns and requirements to make it a first class education tool for teachers and trainers across the world.</p>
