        <p class="first">JS Bin is a form of paste bin, but with a twist. It allows you to also include the HTML and CSS to provide context to your pasty. As such, it means you can actually run the JavaScript and pass this on to a colleague to help to debug.</p>
        <p>What's particularly special about JS Bin, is that once you share the url, anyone can make further changes and keep saving new revisions.</p>
