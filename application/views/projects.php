    <p>R&amp;D is as important for the web as it is for other tech-based industries.</p>
    <p>At Left Logic we are constantly engaged in experimentation, pushing the code to improve stability and efficiency, as well creating completely new possibilities. Everything we learn is passed on to other developers in lectures and workshops around the world.</p>
