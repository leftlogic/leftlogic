    <h1>Professional Training</h1>  
    <p>At Left Logic, we know that many large organisations have in-house development teams. Sometimes it makes more sense to up-skill your own people rather than hiring outside agencies to develop for you.</p>
    <p>So at Left Logic we've packaged some of our expertise. We now offer specific training workshops to in-house teams wishing to brush up on their development skills, from browser compatibility to micro formats.</p>
    <p>Left Logic also offers a tailored consultancy service. <a href="/consultancy">(Click for more information)</a></p>

      <h2>jQuery for Designers</h2>
      <span class="cost">Â£349 + <abbr>VAT</abbr> pp</span>
      <p>You've heard of jQuery, you know it's supposed to do beautiful things, but you don't do JavaScript, and you don't know where all the pieces go to create <em>your</em> beautiful thing. This workshop will ease you in to adding jQuery to your projects, cover what jQuery has to offer and how you can make use of it.</p>

      <p>You'll be learning jQuery from a practical point of view: what you can use out of the box to quickly get effects and interaction live in to your wireframes, prototypes and web sites. The aim <em>isn't</em> to teach you JavaScript, but to teach you what you need to know to be able to leverage jQuery to do your bidding.</p>
