    <h1>Professional Training</h1>  
    <p>At Left Logic, we know that many large organisations have in-house development teams. Sometimes it makes more sense to up-skill your own people rather than hiring outside agencies to develop for you.</p>
    <p>So at Left Logic we've packaged some of our expertise. We now offer specific training workshops to in-house teams wishing to brush up on their development skills, from advanced JavaScript &amp; jQuery, to jQuery for Designers to the latest HTML5 technology.</p>
    <p>Left Logic also offers a tailored consultancy service. <a href="/contact">(Contact us for more information)</a></p>

      <h2>Browsers with Wings: HTML5 APIs</h2>
<?php /*      <span class="cost">£349 + <abbr>VAT</abbr> pp</span>*/?>
      <p>HTML5 has gained a lot of attention over the last 12 months. With browsers increasingly supporting the features of the vast JavaScript APIs both in and around the official HTML5 spec, it's making the job of creating awesome applications purely using these web technologies very easy indeed.</p>
      <p>This full day workshop will introduce you to HTML5 with a brief backstory, before diving into the APIs one by one. As well as going through code and showing practical demonstrations, where possible, we'll also talk about the alternatives for old browsers that don't support "awesome" out of the box.</p>

      <h3>What will be covered?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Video &amp; audio – move over Flash</li>
        <li>Canvas – bring on the Mario games</li>
        <li>Storage – like cookies, but tastes so much better</li>
        <li>Offline – forget the web</li>
        <li>Geolocation – finders keepers</li>
        <li>Web Workers – multithreading for the browser</li>
        <li>Web Sockets – pushing data was never so easy</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Who is this workshop for?</h3>
      <p>You're not expected to have played with HTML5 just yet, but you will need to have a reasonable understanding of HTML &amp; JavaScript. A lot of the individual APIs are being used in popular web sites today both in desktop browsers and mobile, so rest assured that this applies to developers that are working on the web <em>today</em>.</p>

      <h2>Server side JavaScript with Node</h2>

      <p>JavaScript is increasingly seen as the unbiquitous language for developing for the web, so it stands to reason that JavaScript be used for the server side too. </p>

      <p>Node allows for applications to be developed in JavaScript and is running on the incredibly fast V8 engine (the same JavaScript engine used to run Google Chrome). It can handle thousands of concurrent connections due to it&#8217;s event model, and because of this event model, developing for Node is very familiar if you&#8217;ve already written JavaScript for the browser - as this the same event model.</p>

      <h3 id="what_will_be_covered">What will be covered</h3>

      <ul>
      <li>The basics: Async development, modules, requires, exports and scope</li>
      <li>Building web servers: by hand, with Connect, with Express.js</li>
      <li>Working with document databases (mongodb &amp; redis)</li>
      <li>Going real time: WebSockets and Socket.IO</li>
      <li>Releasing and deploying: npm, cluster</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="what_do_you_need_for_this_workshop">What do you need for this workshop?</h3>

      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation">Node installed</a> on your machine (0.4.0 is currently the latest stable release) (<a href="http://blog.tatham.oddie.com.au/2011/03/16/node-js-on-windows/">also available on Windows</a>)</li>
      <li>Ideally have <a href="http://help.github.com/git-installation-redirect/">git installed</a></li>

      <h2>jQuery for Designers</h2>
<?php /*      <span class="cost">£349 + <abbr>VAT</abbr> pp</span> */ ?>
      <p>You've heard of jQuery, you know it's supposed to do beautiful things, but you don't do JavaScript, and you don't know where all the pieces go to create <em>your</em> beautiful thing. This workshop will ease you in to adding jQuery to your projects, cover what jQuery has to offer and how you can make use of it.</p>

      <p>You'll be learning jQuery from a practical point of view: what you can use out of the box to quickly get effects and interaction live in to your wireframes, prototypes and web sites. The aim <em>isn't</em> to teach you JavaScript, but to teach you what you need to know to be able to leverage jQuery to do your bidding.</p>
      <h3>What you'll learn</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How to impress your clients without writing any code</li>
        <li>jQuery – how to bend the DOM to your will</li>
        <li>Effect and animations – make things that go whizz bang</li>
        <li>How to recognise jQuery design patterns</li>
        <li>How almost everything is a tabbing system</li>
        <li>Ajax – it’s even simpler than you think</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Who is this workshop for?</h3>
      <p>This workshop is for front-end visual designers and developers who are familiar with HTML and CSS. If you have flirted with jQuery or JavaScript in the past, this will be an advantage, but is not a necessity.</p>
