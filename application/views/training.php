    <h1>Professional Training</h1>  
    <p>At Left Logic, we know that many large organisations have in-house development teams. Sometimes it makes more sense to up-skill your own people rather than hiring outside agencies to develop for you.</p>
    <p>So at Left Logic we've packaged some of our expertise. We now offer specific training workshops to in-house teams wishing to brush up on their development skills, from advanced JavaScript &amp; jQuery, to jQuery for Designers to the latest HTML5 technology.</p>
    <p>Left Logic also offers a tailored consultancy service. <a href="/contact">(Contact us for more information)</a></p>

      <h2>Mobile Web Apps</h2>

      <p>Building rich interactive web sites...dare I say web apps - is a reality with the smart phone browsers shipping with all the latest JavaScript and CSS technologies.</p>

      <p>This day long workshop will be a mix of introducing the latest technology &amp; tricks on the mobile device and hands on practical exercises where you'll get to play with what you're learning.</p>

      <p>Although this workshop will have an iOS focus, a lot of the technology we will look at applies to most new WebKit based devises (Android, Playbook, etc) and smartphones running Opera Mobile.</p>

      <blockquote cite="James O'Brien">Remy's HTML5 for mobile workshop showed me how to do at least three things I'd previously thought were impossible.</blockquote>

      <h2>Using HTML5 and JavaScript to build Web Apps</h2>
<?php /*      <span class="cost">£349 + <abbr>VAT</abbr> pp</span>*/?>
      <p>HTML5 has gained a lot of attention over the last 12 months. With browsers increasingly supporting the features of the vast JavaScript APIs both in and around the official HTML5 spec, it's making the job of creating awesome applications purely using these web technologies very easy indeed.</p>
      <p>This full day workshop will introduce you to HTML5 with a brief backstory, before diving into the APIs one by one. As well as going through code and showing practical demonstrations, where possible, we'll also talk about the alternatives for old browsers that don't support "awesome" out of the box.</p>

      <blockquote cite="Stuart Elmore">Awesome day! Thank you so much Remy for a fantastic workshop! :) looking forward to using my new knowledge!</blockquote>

      <h3>What will be covered?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Video &amp; audio – move over Flash</li>
        <li>Canvas – bring on the Mario games</li>
        <li>Storage – like cookies, but tastes so much better</li>
        <li>Offline – forget the web</li>
        <li>Geolocation – finders keepers</li>
        <li>Web Workers – multithreading for the browser</li>
        <li>Web Sockets – pushing data was never so easy</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Who is this workshop for?</h3>
      <p>You're not expected to have played with HTML5 just yet, but you will need to have a reasonable understanding of HTML &amp; JavaScript. A lot of the individual APIs are being used in popular web sites today both in desktop browsers and mobile, so rest assured that this applies to developers that are working on the web <em>today</em>.</p>

      <h2>Node & HTML5 for a real-time web</h2>

      <p>JavaScript is increasingly seen as the ubiquitous language for developing for the web, so it stands to reason that JavaScript be used for the server side too. </p>

      <p>Node allows for applications to be developed in JavaScript and is running on the incredibly fast V8 engine (the same JavaScript engine used to run Google Chrome). It can handle thousands of concurrent connections due to it&#8217;s event model, and because of this event model, developing for Node is very familiar if you&#8217;ve already written JavaScript for the browser - as this the same event model.</p>

      <blockquote cite="Matt Smith">Today's workshop was excellent, it's got me really excited about JavaScript again.</blockquote>

      <blockquote cite="Leigh Garland">Get from dev zero to node hero with a workshop by Remy. More learning in two days than you thought you could take (and still remember it!)</blockquote>

      <h2>jQuery for Designers</h2>
<?php /*      <span class="cost">£349 + <abbr>VAT</abbr> pp</span> */ ?>
      <p>You've heard of jQuery, you know it's supposed to do beautiful things, but you don't do JavaScript, and you don't know where all the pieces go to create <em>your</em> beautiful thing. This workshop will ease you in to adding jQuery to your projects, cover what jQuery has to offer and how you can make use of it.</p>

      <p>You'll be learning jQuery from a practical point of view: what you can use out of the box to quickly get effects and interaction live in to your wireframes, prototypes and web sites. The aim <em>isn't</em> to teach you JavaScript, but to teach you what you need to know to be able to leverage jQuery to do your bidding.</p>

      <blockquote cite="Prisca Schmarsow">A day of lightbulbs ~ you demystified jQuery for me—made it easy to understand, now happily working with what you taught me, thank you.</blockquote>
      <!-- https://twitter.com/#!/prisca_eyedea/status/156439063635820544 -->

      <!-- https://twitter.com/#!/byrichardpowell/status/156429746304061440 -->

      <h3>What you'll learn</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How to impress your clients without writing any code</li>
        <li>jQuery – how to bend the DOM to your will</li>
        <li>Effect and animations – make things that go whizz bang</li>
        <li>How to recognise jQuery design patterns</li>
        <li>How almost everything is a tabbing system</li>
        <li>Ajax – it’s even simpler than you think</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Who is this workshop for?</h3>
      <p>This workshop is for front-end visual designers and developers who are familiar with HTML and CSS. If you have flirted with jQuery or JavaScript in the past, this will be an advantage, but is not a necessity.</p>
