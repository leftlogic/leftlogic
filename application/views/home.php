    <p>Left Logic is one of the few web-development agencies that actively define the Internet, instead of the other way around. Our award-winning team is globally recognised. Our client list speaks for itself.</p>
    <p>Our work is influenced by You. Your needs and the needs of your clients drive our design and build process, ensuring your website is finely tuned to your business conditions.
